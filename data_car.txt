bmw_i8     14000
details : Three pistons combusting internally, a dash of electrons and lots of aluminum and carbon fiber are the i8’s main ingredients. Its 357-hp hybrid powertrain drives all four wheels; in our hands, the i8 hit 60 mph in 4.0 seconds and saw 38 MPGe on our 200-mile test run. The poised chassis and sharp steering are good fun, but eco-friendly tires and regenerative braking hinder performance. Familiar controls nestle in a plush cabin; the i8’s eye-catching styling is straight out of a sci-fi flick.

details : Affluent driving enthusiasts will love the 7-series, both for its luxurious cabin and its surprising agility. The iDrive system controls infotainment with gesture control; there’s wireless charging for smartphones.

Rear-drive is standard; all-wheel drive is standard on the plug-in and optional on the V-8. The Alpina B7 has a 600-hp V-8.

mazda3 2000
details : Not many vehicles successfully combine style, dynamics, and value in a compact package, but the Mazda 3 does, which is why it’s a 10Best winner. Hatchback or sedan bodies are available; a slick six-speed manual and a 155-hp 2.0-liter four are standard, while a six-speed automatic and a 2.5-liter 184-hp four are options. The responsive steering and great handling will have drivers dreaming of twisty roads. Even add-ons such as nav, traffic-sign recognition, and heated seats won’t break the bank.

toyota_camry 3000
details : For the majority of people to whom a car is merely an appliance, the Camry meets their needs perfectly. Those seeking a zestier ride should look elsewhere. A 178-hp four-cylinder is standard, while a 268-hp V-6 offers some serious zip. Both have a six-speed automatic; a manual is not available. There’s a hybrid, rated up to 38 mpg on the highway. The XSE aims at enthusiasts with a stiffer suspension and some extra styling bits, but its steering is numb, its braking and handling unexceptional.
